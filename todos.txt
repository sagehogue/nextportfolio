* Create a workflow section where you break down your conceptualization, design, and development processes with some pictures.
* In the contact section, create a way to make a google calendar appointment - setting the meeting on both our google calendars and saving their contact info.. and
emailing me to inform me. 
* Redo SVG on main screen - it loads too slowly

***Major***

1. Contact form doesn't work.
2. About, Services, Contact all lack graphics and polish.
3. Services section is extremely vague, untargeted.
4. Home page graphic loads unacceptably slowly. Perhaps a new one is needed. A recreation? If I clean it up I could create more graphics to make more of an interesting theme.
Difficult to read the image on mobile too. 
5. Viewing projects page on mobile, bottom list item will have an unreadable description because of Call to action blocking visibility. add dead space to bottom in mobile.
6. Lots of the component switching animations are partially broken, generally animating out doesn't happen. Can fix by doing a format of async funcs
that await page generation offscreen and then change state to trigger animation in. 
7. Currently the page is displaying a view with NO DATA INJECTED when the page first loads or is refreshed. 
***Minor***

1. Ugly side scroll bar is visible on Projects lists. 
2. No animation when switching categories on the projects page. 
3. Home page - hover effect on the buttons is clipped on bottom - perhaps change it to a bg-color change effect or something
4. local to global? or maybe "get connected" is better or something.
5. /services - Low contrast of visual elements
6. I may want to reorganize the projects page into "Websites & Apps" and "Components & Effects".
7. Implementing paypal/stripe donations would be dope.

***Major***


1. Browse feature yet to be fully implemented.
    a. Should add a back button to reselect category or cuisine if you don't like your choice of meals. 
    b. Go Back button is not fully implemented and breaks the app when clicked. Also I don't think browse state is fully cleared when navigating to other parts of the app.
    I should create a function to clear state as desired and utilize it whenever state is changed through navigation. 
    c. Browse component does not load if you attempt to load it twice without refreshing. Stale state likely culprit.


2. Search feature yet to be fully implemented.
    a. Lots of animations are broken. Animation when clicking back button is broken. Page Jumps.
    b. If you check out a recipe, you should be able to press "back" and have the search results presented again without having to make a second
    search.
    c. If you press 'new random recipe' from recipe screen you got through search, if you return to search, the input box will have some broken
    text in it. All I need to do is clear the input box when the user leaves the component.
    d. Animation is broken if you go from a searched recipe to the search main screen again. exit and enter animations occur simultaneously.
    e. Search Term not displayed for some reason
    f. Clicking 'New Random Recipe' does not trigger animations properly. 
    g. animateBrowseViewSwitchToSingleRecipe might be causing some sequencing inaccuracy
    h. Go Back button does not function. 
    i. Animations do not perform at: Search -> Browse, Search -> Random Recipe (Nav Link)
    j. If there are too many search results, you can't scroll down and view the offscreen clickables! ahh!

3. Animations should be fully implemented.
    a. There is no exit/enter animation when switching between major components. 
    b. Search component does not sequence properly. Click button, input disappears, loader appears, loader disappears, results appear is the desired order of events. 

4. Ipad screen size is broken for recipe view

5. No back buttons function. 
    a. Actually now some do! Browse screen back buttons are functional. 

6. No Error handling!!!!!!!!!!

***Minor***
1. When a new recipe is fetched, the image does not change before the new recipe is displayed, and so there is a visable flash on screen. 

2. The search "back button" animations are kinda fucked, we're missing an exit animation for the single recipe view -> search result movement.

3. Recipe image does not change at the same time as the text.. should change offscreen ideally. At least the old image should go away before it appears again. 

4. Recipe view sometimes animates into view before data has been injected, causing page jump. 

5. ScrollTop not working - Cannot scroll to top of instructions div.

***Bugs***



***COMPLETE/SOLVED***
(search)f. I think I can solve the issue of simultaneous animations occuring when a recipe clickable is clicked by using useEffect to trigger the animation at the time of data population
(search)a. If no results are found, a "go back" button should be presented. Currently there is one but it has no functionality. 
* Buttons DO NOT show pointer when hovered. 
* Hugely lacking in the "mobile optimization" department. Like everything is just fucked, I haven't even looked in detail. 
* There is A LOT of page jiggle going on as things are resized on render. Reserving space in the visual hierarchy for them should fix this.
* The loader symbol presented when data is fetching is not properly centered in mobile or desktop.
*  Categories are shifting when loader is on screen. 
* I need a generic page window for the browse/random recipe. Something to handle transitioning in/out when content is to be changed
* All/Category/Cuisine buttons currently do not change state when clicked. They have clickhandlers so I am not sure why.
* I do not have a recipe view that can be used for the random recipe and a recipe you get from this yet. I like the idea of a back button for the browsed recipes but it is
not necessary.
* So you can select a single recipe to view through the browse menu but it will not be visible on screen, though the data is loaded through
the "getSpecificRecipe" function. Next up is to ensure the data is properly rendered onto the user's screen, and that all state is properly
set so that there will not be any unexpected behavior. 
* "Single recipe view" should be created and shared between random recipe and a recipe reached through the browse menu.
* I should create an option on the loader function to sequence two views without showing the loader in between, for when I need to change the
view but I do not need to perform any asynchronous actions. 
* Animations are pretty fucked. I think I'm using the package wrong, I don't think I need variants. Some refactor will be necessary to deal with
the animations having different triggers. Whoops.

***Major***
1. Browse feature yet to be fully implemented.

2. Search feature yet to be implemented.
***Minor***
1. When a new recipe is fetched, the image does not change before the new recipe is displayed, and so there is a visable flash on screen. 
2. Browse needs a back button to support better browsing. 
***Bugs***

1. Page content not appopriately sized on 1920x1080 monitor, scrollbar shows in ugly fashion. 
2. The page content is not properly centered on mobile. 

***COMPLETE/SOLVED***
* The loader symbol presented when data is fetching is not properly centered in mobile or desktop.
*  Categories are shifting when loader is on screen. 
* I need a generic page window for the browse/random recipe. Something to handle transitioning in/out when content is to be changed
* All/Category/Cuisine buttons currently do not change state when clicked. They have clickhandlers so I am not sure why.
* I do not have a recipe view that can be used for the random recipe and a recipe you get from this yet. I like the idea of a back button for the browsed recipes but it is
not necessary.
* So you can select a single recipe to view through the browse menu but it will not be visible on screen, though the data is loaded through
the "getSpecificRecipe" function. Next up is to ensure the data is properly rendered onto the user's screen, and that all state is properly
set so that there will not be any unexpected behavior. 
* "Single recipe view" should be created and shared between random recipe and a recipe reached through the browse menu.

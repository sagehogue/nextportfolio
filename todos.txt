1. Browse feature yet to be fully implemented.
    a. Should add a back button to reselect category or cuisine if you don't like your choice of meals. 

2. Search feature yet to be fully implemented.
    a. If no results are found, a "go back" button should be presented. Currently there is one but it has no functionality. 
    b. If you check out a recipe, you should be able to press "back" and have the search results presented again without having to make a second
    search.
    c. If you press 'new random recipe' from recipe screen you got through search, if you return to search, the input box will have some broken
    text in it. All I need to do is clear the input box when the user leaves the component.
    d. Animation is broken if you go from a searched recipe to the search main screen again. exit and enter animations occur simultaneously.

1. When a new recipe is fetched, the image does not change before the new recipe is displayed, and so there is a visable flash on screen. 

2. The search "back button" animations are kinda fucked, we're missing an exit animation for the single recipe view -> search result movement.

***COMPLETE/SOLVED***
* Buttons DO NOT show pointer when hovered. 
* Hugely lacking in the "mobile optimization" department. Like everything is just fucked, I haven't even looked in detail. 
* There is A LOT of page jiggle going on as things are resized on render. Reserving space in the visual hierarchy for them should fix this.
* The loader symbol presented when data is fetching is not properly centered in mobile or desktop.
*  Categories are shifting when loader is on screen. 
* I need a generic page window for the browse/random recipe. Something to handle transitioning in/out when content is to be changed
* All/Category/Cuisine buttons currently do not change state when clicked. They have clickhandlers so I am not sure why.
* I do not have a recipe view that can be used for the random recipe and a recipe you get from this yet. I like the idea of a back button for the browsed recipes but it is
not necessary.
* So you can select a single recipe to view through the browse menu but it will not be visible on screen, though the data is loaded through
the "getSpecificRecipe" function. Next up is to ensure the data is properly rendered onto the user's screen, and that all state is properly
set so that there will not be any unexpected behavior. 
* "Single recipe view" should be created and shared between random recipe and a recipe reached through the browse menu.
* I should create an option on the loader function to sequence two views without showing the loader in between, for when I need to change the
view but I do not need to perform any asynchronous actions. 
* Animations are pretty fucked. I think I'm using the package wrong, I don't think I need variants. Some refactor will be necessary to deal with
the animations having different triggers. Whoops.

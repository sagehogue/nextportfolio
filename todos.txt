***Major***
1. Browse feature yet to be implemented.
    a. All/Category/Cuisine buttons currently do not change state when clicked. They have clickhandlers so I am not sure why.
    b. The clickables do not have clickhandlers, and so do not fetch the respective categories when you search. 
    c. I do not have a recipe view that can be used for the random recipe and a recipe you get from this yet. I like the idea of a back button for the browsed recipes but it is
    not necessary.
1. Search feature yet to be implemented.
***Minor***
1. When a new recipe is fetched, the image does not change before the new recipe is displayed, and so there is a visable flash on screen. 
2. I need a generic page window for the browse/random recipe. Something to handle transitioning in/out when content is to be changed
***Bugs***

1. Page content not appopriately sized on 1920x1080 monitor, scrollbar shows in ugly fashion. 
2. The page content is not properly centered on mobile. 

***COMPLETE/SOLVED***
* The loader symbol presented when data is fetching is not properly centered in mobile or desktop.
*  Categories are shifting when loader is on screen.
